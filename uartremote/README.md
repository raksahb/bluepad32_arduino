# UartRemote BluePad32

Recently Arduino support is added to [BluePad32](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32). The documentation of how to setup the Arduino environment for compiling BluePad32 can be found [here](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/blob/main/docs/plat_arduino.md).

Once you get the BluePad32_ESP32 Controler example running, you can install the uartremote library.
The easiest way is to load the library in the Arduino IDE as a zip file: Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .Zip file. Select UartRemote.zip from this repository.
